# Recommendations for further optimization:
# 
# 1. **Short term (minimal changes)**:
#    - Use the random_sample_optimized function above
#    - Pre-convert generators.items() to list if called multiple times
#    - Consider caching q tensor if probs shape is constant
#
# 2. **Medium term (requires some refactoring)**:
#    - Pass generator seeds as tensors instead of Generator objects
#    - Implement batched seeded RNG in C++/CUDA
#    - Fuse exponential + div + argmax into single kernel
#
# 3. **Long term (architectural changes)**:
#    - Move sampling entirely to GPU with custom CUDA kernels
#    - Implement hierarchical sampling for better memory locality
#    - Use persistent kernels to avoid kernel launch overhead
#
# The current bottleneck is fundamentally the Python loop overhead when
# dealing with Generator objects. The only way to truly optimize this is
# to move away from Python Generator objects to a more GPU-friendly approach.
